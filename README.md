## Project Description
Our project, PYTHNX, is our take on the indie game, SNKRX. The player controls a snake-like character made of segments/heroes that can be purchased with currency acquired from the game. The segments automatically attack the enemies approaching the snake, so it is up to the player to keep the snake from harm. Unique builds can be created and bonuses can be activated from assembling different compositions of heroes, as the player combats endless waves of enemies.
